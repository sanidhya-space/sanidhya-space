I am an Engineer currently working at ISTRAC Bengaluru, India. I come from Dhar, a small town near Indore (M.P.). I have completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I love to talk about future of humans on Earth (or may be on Mars :P). In my free time, I try to go out and click pictures of Nature and Wildlife.
