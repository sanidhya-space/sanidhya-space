I am an Engineer currently working at [HEX20](https://hex20.space/). Prior to it, I worked at [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/index.html)'s Ground Network [ISTRAC](https://www.istrac.gov.in/) at Bengaluru, India. I come from Dhar, a small town near Indore (M.P.). I have completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree from [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://iist.ac.in/). I love to talk about future of humans on Earth (or may be on Mars :P). In my free time, I try to go out and click pictures of Nature and Wildlife.
