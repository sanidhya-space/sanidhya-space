One fine day, towards the end of my final semester (May 2019) at [IIST](https://www.iist.ac.in/), my professor [Dr. Priyadarshnam](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/priyadarshnam) calls me up for a meeting with the Dean R&D. He asked to attend the meeting and propose a project idea. It was about 11 AM in the morning and the meeting was scheduled at around 1 PM in afternoon. I had just woken up and was barely in my senses. I started recollecting all the thoughts and ideas by now.

Taking inspiration from [ARIS](https://www.iist.ac.in/aris) which had just flown aboard [PSLV-C45](https://www.isro.gov.in/mission_PSLV_C45.html) (which functioned pretty well in the spent fourth stage of PSLV), I too started thinking in that direction. 

During my first semester, I was working at the Satellite lab (now [SSPACE](https://www.iist.ac.in/sspace)) for the development of an [On-board computer for small satellites](https://sanidhyavijaywat.co.in/projects/IIST-OBC/). At the same time, a TTC board was also under development at the lab. Both of these boards were almost ready and all they needed was power and a 1U supporting structure.

Now that I had an OBC and a TTC, which was to fly aboard PSLV, I named it **P**SLV **I**n-orbita**L** testing of **O**BC and **T**TC or **PILOT**.
I presented this idea on a two slide PPT during the meeting, and it was well appreciated. Today, after almost four years, after a few changes, the idea is materialized, and PILOT is all set to fly aboard POEM-2 of [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/)'s PSLV C-55.

As ISRO is preparing itself for the launch of its workhorse rocket PSLV on [22nd April 2023](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-pslv-c55-mission-isro-uses-new-rocket-integration-technique-to-cut-time/articleshow/99446716.cms?from=mdr), I am eagerly waiting for PILOT to fly. I am sure this excitement is much more for the students and faculty members who have worked on the project.
