Watching a rocket launch was always on my bucket list. Fortunately, I could check it by witnessing the spectacular launch of ISRO’s Bahubali (so called) rocket LVM3. The launch was scheduled on 26th March 2023 (Sunday) at 9:00 AM.

LVM3 rocket launch on Sunday is a rare opportunity. Also, nothing can be a better treat for a weekend than experiencing the bright yellow burning tail of a rocket going up in the sky.

Entering the launch gallery was totally different feeling altogether. People were carrying the Indian flags and were cheering for ISRO and India.

As the vehicle cleared the launch tower, everyone’s eyes were just focued on the tip of the rocket as it smoothly cut through the clouds. I tried to capture the video with my camera. Here’s the launch footage with my camera -

## Few tips on witnessing the launch
1. Book your passes on ISRO's SHAR website - [link here](https://lvg.shar.gov.in/VSCREGISTRATION/index.jsp).
2. Registration will require your AADHAR and Vehicle details, so keep them handy while registering.
3. Carry Umbrella and Sunscreen, since it gets too hot during the Day.
